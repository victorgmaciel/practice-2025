Assignment
While the influencers who use our platform are really great at taking selfies, most aren't super great at math.
 We need to write a tool that predicts an influencer's follower growth over time.

Complete the get_follower_prediction function.

"fitness" influencers: follower count quadruples each month
"cosmetic" influencers: follower count triples each month
All other influencers: follower count doubles each month
For example, if a fitness influencer starts with 10 followers, then after 1 month they should have 40 followers.
 After 2 months, they would have 160 followers; etc.

Use a geometric sequence formula that's slightly modified for this problem: total = a1 * r^n
